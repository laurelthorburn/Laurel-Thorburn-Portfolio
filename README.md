# REACT-Portfolio

<a name="descsection"></a>
## Description
Welcome to my portfolio.  This site utilizes ReactJS to create a single page application, along with emailJs, Validate, and more.  The user is able to view my react skills and a variety of projects I have worked on over the past few months.  In addition, using emailJs, the user is able to send me an email so that we can discuss what I can bring to your team.
